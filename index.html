            <p class="header title1">Chicken</p>
            <p class="content">Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.
              Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, 
              and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. 
              Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. 
              Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol 
              and saturated fat.

            <p class="content">Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork.
              Bacon is prepared from several different cuts of meat,
               typically from the pork belly or from back cuts, which have less fat than the belly.
               One 10-g slice of cooked side bacon contains 4.5 g of fat, 3.0 g of protein, 
               and 205 mg of sodium.

            <p class="content">Bird eggs have been valuable foodstuffs since prehistory, 
              in both hunting societies and more recent cultures where birds were domesticated.
              The most commonly used bird eggs are those from the chicken, duck, and goose eggs.
              Egg yolks and whole eggs store significant amounts of protein and choline,
               and are widely used in cookery
